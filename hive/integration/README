== Time based partitioning ==

By convention all date based partitioning is assigned to 2001-01-15T19:00:00.
Using a historical date helps remind everyone this is test data. Having a
constant date allows test invocations of airflow tasks and bare scripts against
an expected date and time.

== Kinds of files are found here

=== create_*.hql

These are tables used within the integration testing environment as doubles for
production tables. These are tables that either don't have a canonical hql (i.e.
created by transforming a jsonschema in eventgate) or we simply didn't know
where to find it.

Files were created by running `show create table` in the analytics-hadoop cluster
and lightly editing the outputs.

=== populate_*.json

Files processed by spark/populate_integration.py. These files specify a specific
hive partition to populate and the rows to populate them with. Unspecified
fields will be set to NULL. Unknown fields will fail the import. These are
used for the integration testing environment to provide data to execute
against.

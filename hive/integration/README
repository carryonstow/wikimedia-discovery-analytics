== Time based partitioning ==

By convention all date based partitioning is assigned to 2038-01-17T21:00:00.
Using a far future date helps remind everyone this is test data, and having a
constant date allows running test invocations of airflow tasks and bare scripts
against an expected date.

== Kinds of files are found here

=== create_*.hql

These are tables used within the integration testing environment as doubles for
production tables.  These tables that either don't have a canonical hql (i.e.
created by transforming a jsonschema in eventgate) or we simply didn't know
where to find it.

Files were created by running `show create table` in the analytics-hadoop cluster
and lightly editing the outputs.

=== populate_*.hql

These are insert statements used to populate the various tables and facilitate
integration testing. This works well for simple data without complex data types.

=== populate_*.py

These are pyspark scripts meant to be executed to populate various tables. Pyspark
is more convenient for inserting complex data types, and generating fake data for
complex schemas. By convention any data not explicitly needed for processing is set
to null.

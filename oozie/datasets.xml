Defines reusable datasets for aggregated pageview percentages data.
Use this dataset in your coordinator.xml files by setting:

    ${popularity_score_data_directory} - Path to directory where popularity score data is stored.
        Example: /wmf/data/wmf/discovery/popularity_score
    ${popularity_score_esbulk_data_directory} - Path to directory where popularity score in esbulk format is stored.
        Example: /wmf/data/wmf/discovery/popularity_score_esbulk

    <!--
    The discovery_popularity_score dataset contains aggregated pageviews
    over a week stored as the percentage of page views of the
    project.

    Note that we do not use “${...}” but “${"$"}{...}", as dataset files are
    passed to EL twice in cascade, and in the first EL level, ${MONTH}
    evaluates to the string “${MONTH}”. Hence, we escape the dollar sign in
    “${....}" to “${"$"}{...}”. At the first EL level, “${"$"}” gets turned
    into a dollar sign, and “{...}”  is just passed along. Hence, we arrive
    at “${...}” as input for the second EL level. There, the variables hold
    their expected values, and we can start unpadding them.

Each file here must be a json dict containing variables to import to the
production instance. A file may define one or more variables. Convention is
for each independent unit (whatever that is) to have it's own .json file
defining the set of related variables.

Variables defined here will be imported to the production instance when scap
deployment promotes a deployment to active. There is room for race conditions
here, If variables are changing in a non-compatible way the relevant dags must
be paused while the deployment is run, and then re-enabled (future work may
stop the scheduler or some other approach during deployment to avoid races).

No affordance is provided for deleting unused variables from the production
installation. An operator (typically human) must clean up the unused variables
post-deployment.
